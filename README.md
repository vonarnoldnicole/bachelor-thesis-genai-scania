This project explores how Generative AI can be leveraged to optimize internal processes at Scania. Through interviews, secondary data, and analytical frameworks such as the Technology Acceptance Model, Socio-Technical Systems Theory, and Kotterâ€™s Change Management Theory, we highlight both opportunities and challenges of implementing AI in a global industrial organization.

Key Findings:
Efficiency gains - GenAI automates repetitive tasks and frees up time for strategic work.
Enhanced decision-making - Improved data access and analytics enable faster, more reliable decisions.
Cultural impact - Successful adoption requires organizational change management.
Challenges - Integration costs, data protection, user acceptance, and ethical concerns.

Conclusion
GenAI holds strong potential to streamline and transform business operations. However, successful integration depends on technical infrastructure, workforce upskilling, and ethical awareness.
